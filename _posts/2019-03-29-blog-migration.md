# Migrating my blog to itsbilal.com/blog

I used to blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@itsbilal), and going forward I'll
be blogging here instead, because [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is cool.

My Medium posts
ranged on topics from [why Jack Dorsey is wrong about university](https://medium.com/@itsbilal/school-isnt-useless-no-matter-what-a-lucky-rich-guy-says-here-s-what-university-taught-me-29ebdb1b9d16), to [why you shouldn't go to a hackathon just to win prizes](https://medium.com/@itsbilal/how-to-win-at-hackathons-bc4c5a10908c), to [how you can stop comparing yourself to others in university](https://medium.com/@itsbilal/feel-like-you-dont-belong-at-uwaterloo-computer-science-software-engineering-here-s-why-you-do-f821864e3e06). They will remain up on Medium, in perpetuity.

Thanks a ton for following!
