I’m Bilal Akhtar, a software developer by profession, and a human in general. There’s a lot to learn from the world, and I want to keep my impact on it positive.

I like writing about things I experience and learn, and sometimes I’ll polish it up into a blog post. I also read non-fiction, bike, follow the news, and spend hours staring at impressionist art every once in a while.

I spend my days at Cockroach Labs, working on the storage layer, log-structured-merge trees, and the like. I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2019, where I was fairly involved in student advocacy.
