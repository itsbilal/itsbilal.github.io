I'm a software developer, a teenager in high school, a wannabe entrepreneur, and everything in between.</p>

<p>
In the past, I've contributed to desktop-based open source projects like GNOME and Ubuntu. More recently, I've shifted focus towards developing my own projects involving web services and mobile apps.

At the moment, I'm occupied with school work and educational stuff. But... if you think I may be interested in doing something in my free time, or just think I could be helpful to you in any way, feel free to shoot me <strike>a MySpace message</strike> <a href="mailto:me@itsbilal.com"><i>an e-mail</i></a>.
