I'm a software developer with experience in building web applications and Android mobile applications. I'm also proficient in managing Debian/Ubuntu based Linux desktops, servers and cloud servers. <br><br>

I'm skilled in programming languages such as C/C++, Python, PHP, Java, HTML, CSS and JS and in frameworks such as GTK (for desktop applications), and jQuery, Django and CakePHP (for web applications).<br><br>

I'm also a supporter of Linux and FOSS in general, and continue to contribute bug reports and patches to many FOSS projects, most notably Ubuntu and Debian.
