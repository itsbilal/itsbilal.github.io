I'm known mainly for my code contributions to open-source projects such as Ubuntu, Debian and GNOME.
</p>

<p>
From 2008 to 2012, I did a wide variety of work within these macroprojects. I was a regular code contributor to Unity, Software Center, Empathy, One Hundred Papercuts project and some Debian packages.

In late 2012, I distanced myself from all serious coding commitments. Since then, most of my coding effort has been dedicated to my own long-term projects, which I hope to launch after high school.
